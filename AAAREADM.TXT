          Authors: Craig Leres and Jef Poskanzer

          Operating System: VAX/VMS V4.4

          Abstract:     Conquest    is    a    multi-player    real-time
          screen-oriented space war  game.  It  is  based  on  the  game
          called  "empire"  on  the  PLATO  computer  system. It runs on
          virtually any kind of cursor addressable crt.

          This version includes many new features  and  bug  fixes.  One
          important addition is computer controlled robot ships.

          Note:  This distribution contains complete Ratfor game source.
          But  since  Ratfor  isn't   a   standard   language,   FORTRAN
          translations  are  also  provided.  The  game  also  relies on
          Software Tools support routines; these are provided in  object
          module form only.

          Privileges  are  required  to install the game (but not to run
          it). Elaborate restrictions on the game can  be  specified  by
          the installer.
