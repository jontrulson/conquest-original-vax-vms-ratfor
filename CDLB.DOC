          DESCRIPTION
               Cdlb   is  a  package  of  routines  to  help  you  write
               screen-oriented  (non-cpu-bound)  programs.  Cdlb   keeps
               track  of things in two buffers; one is called the actual
               image and the other is  called  the  desired  image.  The
               actual  image  always  is the same as what is actually on
               the terminals screen. The actual  image  is  modified  to
               look like the desired image when cdplay() is called.

               Normally,  you manipulate the desired image and then call
               cdplay() to draw the screen.

               Cdlb uses sclb(lib) to find out about terminal  dependent
               features;   it  also  uses  iolb(lib)  to  perform  "raw"
               terminal  i/o.  Terminals  that  use  cdlb  programs  are
               required to:

                   (1) not be hardcopy terminals

                   (2) have   the   ability   to   do   absolute  cursor
                       addressing OR have the  ability  to  do  relative
                       cursor addressing and move the cursor to home

                   (3) have the ability to clear the screen

               cdinit     initializes  cdlb.  Cdinit() clears the actual
                          and desired  images  and  must  be  the  first
                          routine called from cdlb.

               cdend      terminates  cdlb.  This routine must be called
                          before exiting.

               cdredo     force  a  complete   screen   refreash.   This
                          routine  clears both the terminals display and
                          the actual image.

               cdclear    clears the desired image.

               cdclra     clears  a  rectangular  area  of  the  desired
                          image.  "Minlin"  and  "maxlin"  are the first
                          and last  lines  of  the  area  to  clear  and
                          "mincol"  and  "maxcol" are the first and last
                          columns of the area to clear.

               cdclrl     clears  one  or  more  lines  of  the  desired
                          screen  image.  "Lin"  is  the  first  line to
                          clear and "numlins" is the number of lines  to

                          clear.

               cdput      puts  a character into the desired image. "Ch"
                          is the character to  put  on  the  screen  and
                          "lin"  and  "col"  are  the line and column to
                          put it on.

               cdputs     puts a string into the  desired  image.  "Str"
                          is  the  string to put on the screen and "lin"
                          and "col"  specify  the  line  and  column  to
                          place the string.

               cdputc     puts   a   string   into  the  desired  image,
                          centered. "Str" is the string to  put  on  the
                          desired  image and "lin" is the line to put it
                          on.

               cdputn     puts a number into the  desired  image.  "Int"
                          is  the number and "lin" and "col" specify the
                          position.  "Minwid"  specifies   the   minimum
                          width  and  the  number is padded with blanks,
                          if necessary.

               cdputr     puts a real number  into  the  desired  image.
                          This   routine   is   otherwise   similar   to
                          cdputn().

               cdfont     changes to the desired  font.  Each  character
                          in  the desired image has a font. Changing the
                          desired  font  changes  the  font   that   new
                          characters  placed  in  the desired image will
                          receive.

               cdgfont    returns the description of the current font.

               cdsngfont  returns the description of a  font  which  has
                          just   the   attribute   "att"  set.  Possible
                          attributes      are       ATTRIBUTE_HIGHLIGHT,
                          ATTRIBUTE_UNDERLINE,        ATTRIBUTE_REVERSE,
                          ATTRIBUTE_BLINK,    ATTRIBUTE_GRAPHICS,    and
                          ATTRIBUTE_ALTERNATE.

               cdnulfont  returns  the description of a font that has no
                          attributes set.  This  is  called  the  normal
                          font  and  it  that is in effect when cdinit()
                          is called.

               cdandfont  returns the description of  a  font  that  has
                          all  attributes  that  are  set  in both fonts
                          "f1" and "f2" at once.

               cdorfont   returns the description of  a  font  that  has
                          all  attributes  that  are  set in either font
                          "f1" or "f2".

               cdnotfont  returns the description of  a  font  that  has
                          all  the  attributes  that are not in the font
                          "f1".

               cdline     draws a line. The  line  is  drawn  from  line
                          "lin1"  column  "col1"  to  line "lin2" column
                          "col2". The line must be either horizontal  or
                          vertical.

               cdmove     specifies the desired cursor position.

               cdbox      draws a box defined by the two points.

               cdplay     optimaly  updates  the  actual  image  to look
                          like the desired image.

                          An important  feature  to  note  is  that,  if
                          "stoponinput"  is  .true.,  the routine checks
                          every so  often  whether  any  new  characters
                          have   been  typed  by  the  user.  If  a  new
                          character is available, the routine will  stop
                          updating  the screen and return immediately to
                          allow  the  main  program   to   process   the
                          character.

               cdgets     reads  a  line via the screen. Cdgets() writes
                          the prompt "pmt" at the position specified  by
                          "lin"  and  "col"  and  then reads a line from
                          the terminal, which  is  returned  in  str.  A
                          maximum  of  "maxlen"  characters  will be put
                          into "str", although more may be read.

                          You can erase characters  with  either  delete
                          or  backspace.  You  can  erase  the line with
                          either control-x or control-u. You  can  erase
                          the   last   word   with  control-w.  You  can
                          redisplay  the  screen   with   control-l   or
                          redisplay the line with control-r.

                          If  no string is input, ERR is returned as the
                          status; otherwise OK.

               cdgetx     reads  a  line  via  the  screen,   specifying
                          terminating  characters.  Characters  are read
                          up to one of the terminator characters in  the
                          string "terms".

                          Characters   are    read  up  to  one  of  the
                          terminator  characters  and  the   terminating
                          character  is  returned as the function value.
                          Otherwise,  this  is  routine  is  similar  to
                          cdgets().

               cdgetp     Similar  to  cdgetx(),  this  routine uses the

                          user  can  edit  the  string using delete, ^W,
                          etc., as with cdgetx() and cdgets().

               cdgetn     read  a  number  via  the   screen.   Cdgetn()
                          prompts  for  a  number  as  in  cdgets()  and
                          returns it in  num.  Cdgets  is  used.  If  no
                          number  is  input,  ERR  is  returned  as  the
                          status; otherwise OK.

               When first learning how to  use  cdlb,  keep  it  simple.
               I.e. don't fool around with fonts or lines.

               Sometimes,  the  screen will get screwed up by a terminal
               broadcast or something. Here's one  easy  way  to  redraw
               the screen:

                   call cdredo                # force a refreash
                   call cdplay ( .false. )    # draw the screen again

               There  are really two ways to use cdclear() when you want
               to put a different image up on the screen. For example:

                   call cdinit
                   <modify the desired image>
                   call cdplay ( .false. )
                   call cdclear
                   <modify the desired image again>
                   call cdplay ( .false. )

               In this example, the first time cdplay() is  called,  the
               screen  is  updated as expected. The second time cdplay()
               is called, the screen is  updated  by  changing  what  is
               already on the screen.

               Now another example:

                   call cdinit
                   <modify the desired image>
                   call cdplay ( .false. )
                   call cdclear
                   call cdredo                       # force a redraw
                   <modify the desired image again>
                   call cdplay ( .false. )

               This  example  is  just  like the previous one except the
               second time cdplay() is called,  the  screen  is  cleared
               and  the new characters are simply displayed on the clean
               screen.
