08Sep85:  A completely  new  robot  strategy  has been installed!
          Watch out, because robots are  sssmmmaaarrrttt now.

16Jun84:  You can now get a list of recent  users  with  the  'H'
          command.

13Jun84:  The new user stats page finally works!

11Jun84:  You can now get info on a user.

09Jun84:  Hacking  on temperature. Weapons and engines now have a
          chance of breaking when they get too hot.  Tuning  will
          continue for a little while.

27May84:  Bombing  and  beaming  have  been  modified so that the
          baud rate of your terminal doesn't have  such  a  large
          effect.

22Feb84:  Message  editing  implemented.  If you enter enter line
          feed as the target of a message, you  can  send  a  new
          message  by  editing  the target and text from the last
          message you sent (or attempted to send).

19Feb84:  You can now do info on "time".

11Feb84:  The driver bug that made bombing easy and ships  faster
          than  speeding  torps  has  been  fixed. Also, it is no
          longer possible for two terminals to control  the  same
          ship.  Now,  when  you reincarnate, you get to keep the
          same ship number.

15Jan84:  You can  now  switch  teams  as  long  as  you  haven't
          entered  any  ships  since  the last time you resigned.
          Weapons  defaulting  implemented;   firing   a   weapon
          without  specifying  a  direction  defaults to the last
          direction you fired any weapon.

14Jan84:  The tractor command has been split into  two  commands.
          Use  't'  to  tractor another ship and 'u' to untractor
          or attempt to  break  free  of  another  ships  tractor
          beams.  Also,  when  you attempt to tractor a ship, its
          velocity relative to your ship must be warp 2 or less.

          Shields now regenerate  twice  as  fast  (4  units  per
          second) when they are down.

09Jan84:  Robot  ships  now  automatically defend the home system
          from attack. Ship tuning continues.

20Dec83:  Massive ship tuning in progress...

10Dec83:  A new fuel usage formula has been  installed;  now  any
          activity  that uses fuel generates heat and adds to the
          temperature of the ship. Also, a bug which  caused  the
          autopilot  to overshoot planets has been discovered and
          fixed.

17Nov83:  Phaser base hits have been lowered from 100 to 92.

13Nov83:  New statistics are being kept (but currently, there  is
          no  way  to display them). Typing "i<cr>" will now give
          info on the last thing you ask for info on.

03Nov83:  A better acceleration formula has been installed.

23Oct83:  Tractor beams aren't quite so deadly anymore. (This  is
          a major   blow   to  Klingon  battle  tactics.)  A  new
          acceleration formula that is team  dependent  has  been
          added.  An  orbit  speed  limit has been imposed so now
          you cannot orbit if you are going faster than warp 2.

16Oct83:  Ships now enter at least accurate  info  distance  away
          from their nearest enemy.

15Oct83:  It  is  now  possible  to change war and peace settings
          from the menu.

06Oct83:  Shell spawning was removed. Spawn to DCL instead.

19Sep83:  The first Decus distribution  of  CCCooonnnqqquuueeesssttt  was  mailed
          today.

05Sep83:  Torpedo  detonation has been worked over so that all of
          your active torpedoes go off when you die;  this  means
          that  you  should always get credit for when your torps
          kill the ship that killed  you.  Spawning  to  DCL  was
          added,  use  '$'  followed  by  a  line feed to spawn a
          process.

01Sep83:  The race dependent weapons  factors  have  been  tuned,
          now  Orions are 0.83, Klingons and Federations are 1.0,
          and Romulans are 1.17.  The  course  command  has  been
          modified  so that when you set course for a planet, you
          get the same  information  as  you  do  with  the  info
          command.  Also,  when  you set course for another ship,
          if you terminate your command with line feed, you  will
          get info on the ship.

29Aug83:  The  Evil  Display  Bug took heavy damage yesterday and
          finally  fell  this  evening.  Services  will  be  held
          Wednesday at the Red Hour.

24Aug83:  The   phaser   command  modified  to  set  last  phaser
          direction even if your phasers are not ready  yet.  The
          planet list is now sorted by planet name.

13Aug83:  Torp  alert  code  added. Now you will always be warned
          when enemy torps get within accurate info range.

          Code added  to  (hopefully)  prevent  driver  thrashing
          when cpu time is at a premium.

          Cloaking  modified  to allow "silent running", i.e. you
          can stay cloaked at warp zero for a  long  time.  Also,
          cloaking  fuel  cost depends on speed (cloaking at warp
          10 is vvveeerrryyy expensive).

          Towing modified; the maximum  towing  distance  is  now
          larger.  Also, breaking free of an unfriendly ships tow
          does not always succeed and trying  freezes  your  ship
          up for a whole second.

12Aug83:  Weapon   tuning  continues.  Phasers  are  still  quite
          strong but this will be corrected in the  near  future.
          Now  distance  is  used  to  break  ties  when  you are
          searching for weak planets. This means that if you  ask
          for  info  on the weakest planet with 10 or more armies
          and two planets have 10 armies each, you will  be  told
          about  the  closer  of  the two. Also, the info command
          has been modified to warn you that a planet is  hostile
          when you get info on it.

17Jul83:  Several  bugs  related  to  the  conversion  to the new
          ratfor fixed. Ken's version of  phaser  graphics  added
          (complaints  to  him). Also, there is now a user option
          for phaser graphics.

04Jul83:  CCCooonnnqqquuueeesssttt now runs from decnet ports!

03Jul83:  Planet  movement  is  three  times   smoother.   Novice
          players  will  now  enjoy  fantastic  phaser  graphics.
          Firing phasers no longer locks up your  ship,  but  you
          still  can't  fire  them more often than once a second.
          Torpedos are... different. (Ken was *not* amused.)  The
          remote terminal bug is almost fixed.

          On  its  one year anniversary, CCCooonnnqqquuueeesssttt now runs on two
          Vaxen.

          Remember, this is Be Kind to Klingons  week,  so  don't
          aim for Ken's gonads.

14Jun83:  Full  duplex  screen  updating implemented. Now you can
          see  your   enemy   attacking   even   when   you   are
          constructing  an insult for him. Common block updating.
          Now the common block is flushed to  the  disk  every  5
          minutes.  This  should  take  care  of  the  time  warp
          problem.

23May83:  Captured system entry now works. The  evil  course  360
          wandering bug has been fixed.

13May83:  Even  more  driver  hacking,  now  the  "phase"  of the
          Universe is kept in the common block. This  means  that
          five  minute  things  will happen every five minutes of
          game  time,  etc.  You  can  now  send  mail  to   "The
          Implementors"  by  sending  a  message to "i". Finally,
          the self-destruct code was modified so that  it  really
          takes  fifteen  seconds to exit, even if some cretin is
          running rat4.

07May83:  Tuned driver  startup  logic.  Added  a  new  "nearest"
          thing  to  look  for,  nearest team planet, "ntp". This
          was done to appease  the  CCCooonnnqqquuueeesssttt  GGGoooddd,,,  who  was  not
          happy  with the hack to "nap". Also, all of the nearest
          planet special strings may now  be  qualified  with  an
          army  threshold.  A  new user option, "terse", has been
          added. For the most part, turning this option  shortens
          the  "press  space  for more" prompts. The manual entry
          has been revised; check it out for more information.

29Apr83:  A new and  improved  CCCooonnnqqquuueeesssttt  manual  entry  has  been
          written  and  installed.  The  user  rating formula has
          been improved. When getting information on  or  setting
          course   for  the  nearest  army  planet,  "nap",  only
          planets that are owned by your team and have more  than
          three  armies are considered. Also, if you terminate an
          information command with LF instead  of  CR,  you  will
          get  info  about  the  second  nearest object. Code was
          added to automatically disable insert and  delete  line
          display.  (That's  right, you can throw away your local
          copy  of  termcap  without  getting  seasick!)  Inverse
          video  has been added to the pagefile routine. Finally,
          the CCCooonnnqqquuueeesssttt operator program  is  even  MMMOOORRREEE  powerful
          than before.

14Apr83:  New  command  implemented.  ^R now can be used to force
          the screen to be updated completely. Also, a  new  user
          option  forces  the  screen  to  always  be  completely
          updated, even during battle.

12Apr83:  Many, many more bugs fixed. Many more  features  added.
          Now  LF  can be used to send a message to the last ship
          you sent to. Driver hacking  is  now  complete;  it  is
          IIIMMMPPPOOOSSSSSSIIIBBBLLLEEE  for more than one driver to run at the same
          time. It is not possible to run a driver manually  from
          a terminal.  The  player  ships  now  notice  that  the
          driver has died within 5 seconds.  When  a  the  player
          who  has  the  driver  exits  CCCooonnnqqquuueeesssttt,,,  he  causes the
          driver to kill itself; the other players then  bid  for
          running   it.   This   means   that  the  Game  is  not
          interrupted just because someone logs off.

19Mar83:  Many, many bugs fixed. Many  features  added.  Cloaking
          now   works.   Also,  enhanced  informational  scanning
          implemented.

08Dec82:  Re-organized  the  display  somewhat  to   enable   the
          terminal package to make use of clear-to-end-of-line.

04Nov82:  Implemented  some  restrictions  on playing: no playing
          over  dialups,  by  GUEST,   or   during   prime   time
          (7:00-18:00 weekdays). Priority is set to 2.

28Oct82:  Fixed bug in bombarding.

25Oct82:  Added n, ne, ns, np, nep, nr, nf, and na.

24Oct82:  Added  a  number  of new features, the biggest of which
          is  orbiting  planets.  Also  I  juggled  some  of  the
          parameters in an attempt to make the teams more equal.

18Oct82:  Added  a  "shit-list" flag, to prevent obnoxious people
          from playing. Added a real neat feature  which  finally
          lets  broadcast  messages  from  the  outside world get
          through. Made the game run at a lower priority.

13Oct82:  Changed the "p" command to not enter  a  mode.  Now  it
          just  fires  a  single  torp  and  goes back to command
          mode.

06Oct82:  Fixed a bug,  added  a  feature.  Recompiled  with  the
          re-written raw I/O library - should go faster now.

22Sep82:  Added  a  "last  words" feature - when you conquer, you
          get to leave a message for everyone to see.

20Sep82:  Minor tuning mods. Also the  doomsday  machine  is  now
          both less common and more sadistic.

13Sep82:  After  three  weeks  of  downtime,  I finally found the
          major  bug  in  the  slow-turning  code.  As  usual,  a
          strongly-typed  language  would  have  caught  it right
          away. I believe there are  still  some  minor  problems
          with   slow  turning  -  let  me  know  if  you  notice
          anything.

23Aug82:  Turning now takes time, and  it  takes  more  time  the
          faster you are going. Slow down to turn.

20Aug82:  Ken  the Kunning Klingon discovered an embarrassing bug
          - I had a test reversed in the  routine  takeplanet  so
          that  every  time  you  conquered  a  planet  you  also
          conquered the Universe.

18Aug82:  Fixed  annoyingly  persistent   bug   which   prevented
          planets from being taken.

08Aug82:  Couping  should  work  now.  Watch out for the doomsday
          machine.

29jul82:  I did some rewriting to  try  and  get  the  driver  to
          restart  automatically  when  it dies. It doesn't quite
          work yet, so beware...

27Jul82:  Arrow keys work. Locking onto planets works.

25Jul82:  The universe was conquered for the first time  tonight,
          by  the Orions. It almost worked perfectly. At the last
          instant, the common block  got  locked  up.  Also,  the
          Orion  team  didn't  get  credit for the win. Both bugs
          should be fixed now, so I am  looking  forward  to  the
          next conquest.

24Jul82:  Engine  temperature and fuel consumption are now pretty
          much working. I still have to  do  some  fiddling  with
          the constants to get things exactly right.

18Jul82:  Fixed  a  bug  which prevented anyone but Romulans from
          killing people. On second thought, maybe I should  have
          left it in...

16Jul82:  More    commands    added,    including   info.   Also,
          self-destruct now works even if  the  driver  is  dead.
          This should make Mister Xavier happy.

12Jul82:  You   can   now   change  course  and  fire  torpedoes.
          Commander Saavik immediately took advantage of this  by
          traveling   to   Earth   and   destroying   hoardes  of
          feddie-bears.

03Jul82:  The display works pretty well now. More commands  work.
          The  first  interplanetary  voyage  took  place  today:
          Commander  Saavik  piloted  the  Romulan  flagship   to
          Sirius.  The  ship was incinerated upon arrival. Saavik
          then journeyed to the edge of  the  galaxy,  where  she
          was one again incinerated. Score: galaxy 2, Saavik 0.

02Jul82:  The display started working today. Some commands work.

28Jun82:  Ships  are  flying now. However, the display generation
          and command interpretation still needs to be  done,  so
          it is not much use.

27Jun82:  The  news  option  was installed today. Ships should be
          flying pretty soon. The driver is working, I just  have
          to add the code to launch a ship.
