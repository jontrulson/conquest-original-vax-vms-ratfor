          NAME
               Conquest  -  multi-player real-time screen-oriented space
               war game
               

          SYNOPSIS
               Conquest
               

          DESCRIPTION


               _111... _OOO_bbb_jjj_eee_ccc_ttt _ooo_fff _ttt_hhh_eee _ggg_aaa_mmm_eee...

               The object of the game is twofold. The  short-range  goal
               is  to accumulate "kills" by shooting down enemy players.
               You get one kill point for each  enemy  ship  shot  down,
               plus  some  extra  if  the enemy had kills too. The major
               weapon used to shoot down ships is the photon torpedo.

               The long-range goal is to conquer the universe  for  your
               team  by taking every planet. You take planets by killing
               off the enemy's armies via bombardment, and then  beaming
               your  team's  armies down. When all the planets have been
               taken, the game ends, a new game begins, and  the  player
               who  actually  took  the last planet gets his/her name up
               in lights.

               This section lists the basic commands  of  CCCooonnnqqquuueeesssttt...  The
               next  section lists the more advanced / obscure commands,
               and at the end of this document there is a summary  list.
               The list is also available on-line via the 'h' command.

               0-9,= - To  set  your  warp factor, just type a digit, or
                       '=' for warp 10. The  teams  have  different  top
                       speeds:  8 for Romulans, 9 for Klingons and Feds,
                       and 10 for Orions.

                   k - The 'k' command is used to set your  course.  You
                       can  specify  your  course  a number of different
                       ways:  in  degrees  (0=east,90=north),  via   the
                       arrow  keys  (see  below), a ship number (precede
                       it with an 's'), or a planet  name.  If  you  set
                       course  for  a  planet,  you  have  the option of
                       "locking on" by terminating the line with a  line
                       feed  instead  of  a  carriage  return - then you
                       will orbit automatically when you get there.





                                      - 1 -

                 p,P - These two commands fire photon  torpedoes.  Lower
                       case  'p'  fires  one  at  a  time,  and  is less
                       useful. Upper case 'P' fires a  burst  of  three.
                       When  you  are  in  the  heat of battle, you will
                       want to fire every torp you have got  (nine),  so
                       you  will  almost always use 'P'. You can specify
                       the direction to fire  using  either  degrees  or
                       the arrow keys.

                 d,D - Lower  case  'd'  detonates  near-by  enemy torps
                       before they get close enough to damage  you.  Use
                       this  command  _a  _l_o_t.  Upper  case 'D' detonates
                       your own torps, for instance in case you  missed.
                       Since  you  can  only  have  nine  torps out at a
                       time, this can be useful.

                   B - To capture enemy planets, you first have  to  get
                       rid  of  the  enemy  armies  by  bombarding them.
                       Orbit the planet, type 'B', confirm with  a  line
                       feed,  and  then  watch  your damage closely. You
                       will continue to bombard until you  type  another
                       command.  When your damage gets up above 60 or 70
                       percent, set a warp factor and get out fast.

                   R - After a bombing run, you can repair  your  damage
                       three  times  faster  by  going into repair mode.
                       While repairing, your shields are  down  and  you
                       can't move or fire.

                   b - Once  you  have  blasted  a  planet down to three
                       armies, you can beam your own armies down  to  do
                       hand-to-hand combat and replace them.

                   m - Use  the  'm'  command  to send messages. You can
                       send to single ships  (using  the  ship  number),
                       entire  teams,  (first  letter  of  team name) or
                       everyone ("all"). You can even send  messages  to
                       GOD,  but don't expect an answer. This command is
                       useful for bothering the experts and asking  them
                       annoying   questions.   It  is  also  useful  for
                       trading insults.

                   i - You can get  information  on  planets  and  ships
                       with the 'i' command.

                   Q - The  only  way  out  besides getting killed it to
                       self-destruct. There is a  15-second  time  delay
                       because  it  is not honorable to quit in the heat
                       of battle.

                   h - This command gives you a  short  command  summary
                       (such  as  the  one  that  is found at the end of
                       this document).

                   A - Type 'A' to  change  your  weapons/engines  power
                       allocations.  You  can either enter a new weapons
                       allocation percentage or else type line  feed  to
                       toggle  between  the  two  extremes  of 40/60 and
                       60/40. The power allocation controls things  like
                       how  powerful  your  weapons  are,  how efficient
                       your engines are, etc.

                   C - Cloaking device. You can  activate  the  cloaking
                       device  by  typing  'C'  followed by a line feed.
                       While the cloaking device is  in  operation,  you
                       are  invisible,  even to your teammates. However,
                       the cloaker uses a LOT of energy - so  much  that
                       you  can't  use  your  weapons  while  it's on. A
                       second 'C' will turn it off again.

                   E - Emergency distress signal. A  quick  way  to  let
                       your  team  mates know that you are in trouble is
                       by typing 'E' followed by  a  line  feed.   Every
                       ship  on  your  team (except those who are at war
                       with your team) will get  a  short  message  from
                       you  that  includes  information about your fuel,
                       shields, and ship damage.

                 f,F - These two commands let you  fire  phasers.  Lower
                       case  'f'  is  used  to fire one phaser blast. It
                       takes about one second to fire phasers (and  your
                       shields  are down the whole time!) Upper case 'F'
                       fires phasers again in the same direction.

                   H - This  command  displays  the   list   of   recent
                       CCCooonnnqqquuueeesssttt players.

                   I - You  can  type 'I' to get a menu of user options.
                       By typing the options character, you  can  toggle
                       whether  or  not  the  option  is on. The options
                       are:

                         G Phaser graphics: When  this  option  is  set,
                           your phaser shots are displayed.

                         P Planet  names:  When  this option is set, the
                           names of planets and suns are displayed.

                         A Alarm bell: When this  option  is  set,  your
                           terminal   beeps  whenever  important  things
                           happen. Important things include enemy  ships
                           getting  within  red  alert  range  and enemy
                           photon torpedoes getting too close.

                         I Intruder   alerts:   This   option   controls
                           whether  or  not  you  are  informed of enemy
                           intrusions, such as the  bombing  of  planets
                           owned by your team.

                         N Numeric  map:  If  you have this options set,
                           the number of  armies  that  are  on  planets
                           which  you  have scanned will be displayed on
                           the strategic map.

                         T Terse messages: Makes a few messages  shorter
                           for  the  experienced  player.  Also disables
                           some   navigational   messages    from    the
                           computer.

                         E Explosions:   When   this   option   is  set,
                           explosions are displayed as a pretty  pattern
                           of  '%'  characters.  When  it  is  off,  you
                           cannot see where explosions are occurring.

                   K - Attempt a coup. If all of your team's armies  get
                       killed,  you  may  think  you  are  in deep fecal
                       matter. Not so - you can still get some  back  by
                       pulling a coup. Try it.

                   L - Type  'L'  to  review old messages that have been
                       sent to you.

                   M - Type 'M'  to  toggle  your  display  between  the
                       strategic map and tactical display.

                   N - Pseudonym.   Use  this  command  to  change  your
                       battle name.

                   o - Orbit. Use  'o'  to  come  into  orbit  around  a
                       planet (or a sun, if you want a tan).

                   S - Displays a list of secondary user statistics.

                   t - Tractor  beams.  You can use these to tow another
                       ship, even if it is hostile.

                   T - Team list. Displays a list of team statistics.

                   u - Untractor. Disengage your tractor  beams  if  you
                       are  towing another ship or attempt to break free
                       of another ships tractor beam if  you  are  being
                       towed.

                   U - Displays a list of primary user statistics.

                   W - Type  'W'  to change your war and peace settings.
                       Note  that  there  is  a  10  second  delay   for
                       declaring  war  on  another team. Also, if you do
                       something nasty to another team such as bomb  one
                       of   their  planets,  your  war  with  that  team
                       becomes sticky and  you  may  not  declare  peace
                       with them.

                 -,+ - Use  '+'  to  raise  your  energy shields, '-' to
                       lower  them.  Shields  protect  you  from   enemy
                       weapons;  however, it takes more fuel to fly with
                       them up.

                   ? - To get a list of planets, use the '?' command.

                   $ - Typing  the '$' character followed by a line feed
                       spawns  a  sub-process  to  DCL.  To   exit   the
                       sub-process,  simply  type  "logout". (Note: this
                       command is optional and may not be  supported  at
                       your installation.)

                  ^L - When  you  type  "^L",  the screen is cleared and
                       redrawn.

                  ^R - When you type "^R", the screen is  forced  to  be
                       accurately updated.

               The  easiest  and  quickest way to specify a direction is
               with the  arrow  keys.  These  are  _n_o_t  the  keys  which
               actually  have  arrows on them, if your terminal has any.
               They are merely the letters "qweadzxc" on  the  left-hand
               side  of  your  keyboard, and are called "arrow keys" for
               historical reasons. The keys are assumed to  be  arranged
               as  follows  (if  you  have a Dvorak keyboard, you are in

               You can use them singly, e.g. 'd'  would  be  0  degrees,
               'q'  would  be  135,  etc.  You  can  also  use  them  in
               combination: "ed" would be halfway between 'e'  and  'd',
               which  is  22.5  degrees; "edd" is like 'e' + 'd' + 'd' /
               3, or 15 degrees.

               There are  several  special  strings  you  can  use  when
               setting course or getting information:

                    nes - nearest enemy ship
                     ns - nearest ship
                    nts - nearest (friendly) team ship
                     np - nearest planet
                    nep - nearest enemy planet
                    nrp - nearest friendly (repair) planet
                    nfp - nearest friendly class-M (fuel) planet
                    nap - nearest planet with available armies
                          (greater than 3 total armies)
                    ntp - nearest planet owned by your team
                     wp - weakest planet not owned by your team
                     hp - home planet for your team
                     sN - ship N (where N is a decimal number)
                   time - time of day (info only)

               All  of these can be abbreviated to their shortest unique
               string. Also, for the planets,  you  can  type  a  number
               after  the  special  string to specify an army threshold;
               that is, planets with less than  that  number  of  armies
               won't  be  considered.  For  example, "na8" specifies the
               nearest planet with 8 (eight) or more armies,  "nf14"  is
               the   nearest   fuel  planet  with  14  or  more  armies,
               "nep1000" is the nearest non-scanned planet.

               You can find out about on the second  nearest  object  by
               terminating  your  information  request  with a line feed
               instead of a carriage return. For example,  to  find  out
               about the second nearest planet type "inp<LF>".

               You  can't  use these when firing weapons - that would be
               too easy.
               

          AUTHOR(S)
               CCCooonnnqqquuueeesssttt is based on the  game  called  "empire"  on  the
               PLATO  computer  system.  This  version, for VAX/VMS, was
               written by Jef Poskanzer  and  Craig  Leres  and  is  far
               superior  to  the original. (Not that the original wasn't
               any good - it was.  But this one is GREAT.)  Many  thanks
               to Marshall Spight for finding far too many bugs.

               Technical  consulting  was  provided  by Ken the Kunning,
               Captain Happy, and Commander T'Lydown.
