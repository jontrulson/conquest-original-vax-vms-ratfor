          DESCRIPTION

               This  library  provides  a  simple  method of restricting
               game-playing. The current restrictions are:

                   (1) GUEST may not play games.

                   (2) No games while logged in on a dial-up line  or  a
                       network terminal.

                   (3) No  games  except  during the times listed in the
                       game cron file.

                   (4) Games are played with a base priority of 2.

               In addition, there is an  optional  security  feature  to
               discourage  game players from making copies of a game. If
                    ________               the  truename  parameter  is  an  empty  string,  it   is
               ignored.  If  it  is  a  simple  filename,  it is checked
               against the simple filename of the current image.  If  it
               is  a  full  pathname,  it  is  checked  against the full
               pathname of the current image. If there  is  a  mismatch,
                             removed,                             removed,               the copy gets removed, and the user is berated.

               Valid  times to play are listed in the game cron file. If
               the current time and date matches at least one  entry  in
               this  file,  then  it may well be a "good" time to play a
               game.

               A low level access  to  the  routines  is  provided  thru
               gamlinit().  If  the logical fdial is .true., then dialup
               use is permitted. If the logical fprio  is  .true.,  then
               priority  alteration  occurs.  If  the  logical  fcron is
               .true., then the game cron file is checked. If  fprio  is
               .true.,  despri is used to determine the new priority. If

               despri  is  positive,  then  is  specifies  an   absolute
               priority.  If  it  is negative, then it specifies a delta
               priority. If it is zero, the  default  lowered  priority,
               two  less  than the current priority, is used. Badlist is
               a string  that  contains  account  names  that  are   not
               allowed  to  play,  separated  by COLONs. Badttylist is a
               string that contains terminal name prefixes that may  not
               be  used  to  play, separated by COLONs. Truename behaves
               as above. Cronfile is the file to use for time  checking.
               If it is empty, a default is used.


          FILES
               /misc/lib/gamcron - default list of "legal" times to play.

          BUGS/DEFICIENCIES

               Running  at  a  base  priority  of two is dangerous. (See
               kill(tool) for information on how to unwedge  stuck  game
               processes.)

               A terminal  is  ASSUMED  to  be a dialup if it is has the
               attributes remote and modem.

               Since enlb is kept in iolb, it is necessary to link  with
               iolb. For example:

                   % rc src/program gamlb iolb
