              (2) Build the binaries.

              (3) Copy the common block  into  sys$library,  and  modify
                  sys$manager:systartup.com  so that the common block is
                  installed at bootup time.

          c_conq_antigods
                This  string  lists users that are never allowed to play
                Conquest.                Conquest.                Conquest. Use colons to separate account names.

                "ttb1" disallows only ttb1  while  "ttb"  disallows  all
                ttb ports.

          c_conq_fdial
                This  define  selects whether or not users may play from
                dialup lines, i.e. if it is defined "no" and  the  users

                This define selects whether or not  priority  alteration
                should  occur. If it is defined "yes", then the priority
                                                          c_conq_despri,                                                          c_conq_despri,                is changed  according  to  the  constant  c_conq_despri,
                which is described below.

                be  "yes".  A  positive  value  specifies  an   absolute
                priority  to  run at while in the game. A negative value
                specifies a delta amount below the current  priority  to
                run at.

          Strings that are filenames should valid VAX/VMS filespecs.

          create the binaries. First, make the common block:

              $ @conqcm

                                                Conquest                                                Conquest          Note that it is necessary to make the Conquest  binaries  each
          time a new common block is created.

                         _______ ___          Next, assemble conqfig.mar and make the game binaries:

              $ @build

          You should now have the following binaries:

              conqcm.exe    - the common block
              conquest.exe  - the player program
              conqdriv.exe  - the driver

          Next, add the necessary commands to the system  startup  file,
          sys$manager:systartup.com,   so   that  the  common  block  is
          installed every time the machine boots:

              sys$library:conqcm.exe /write /share
              $ !


          Finally, install the common block manually so you  don't  have
          to  re-boot  right  now.  To  do this, simply type the command
          lines you added to the system startup file by hand.

                                _______ ___          ones you specified in conqfig.mar. It  is  strongly  suggested

          this, type "I", followed by "e" (for everything),  and  answer
          "y".  Now,  the game should be closed, so type "f" to flip the
          open/closed flag.

          have to write your own; check out the appendix.)

          Next, define a  logical  name  that  specifies  your  terminal
          type. For example:

          for  you  to  write  a termcap entry. Information necessary to
                                              ____ ___          write a termcap entry is located in sclb.doc.

                                         _______          Terminals  are  described  in  termcap  by  giving  a  set  of
          capabilities   which   they   have,   and  by  describing  how
          operations are performed.

                     _______          Entries in termcap  consist  of  a  number  of  ":"  separated
          fields.  The first field for each terminal is a unique integer
          to identify it internally. The second field  gives  the  names
          which   are   known   for   the  terminal,  separated  by  "|"
          characters.

                        Conquest                        Conquest          Note   that   Conquest   doesn't   use   insert/delete   line,
          insert/delete  character, or scrolling regions, so don't waste
          time working on adding these attributes.

          On the other hand, if your terminal has  graphics  characters,
          it  is definitely worth the trouble to set up the line drawing
          attributes correctly.

          Finally, it is very important that  autonl  attribute  matches
          the  kind  of  terminal  you  are using. In particular, vt100s
                      all                      all          should have all of their auto-newline settings disabled.
