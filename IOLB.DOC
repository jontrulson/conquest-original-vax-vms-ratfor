          DESCRIPTION
               Iolb  is designed to provide raw-mode I/O to and from the
               user's terminal.  Raw-mode  I/O  is  the  simplest  thing
               possible:  when the user types a character, it is read by
               the program; when the program writes a character,  it  is
               sent  to  the  terminal.   No  line-by-line  reading,  no
               converting tabs to spaces, spaces to tabs, lower case  to
               upper  and  upper  to  lower, no ignoring some characters
               and   intercepting   others...    nothing   but    simple
               read-a-character, write-a-character.

               ioinit       initializes  iolb.  Ioinit()  must be called
                            before any other routines in iolb.

               ioend        terminates  iolb.  This  routine   must   be
                            called before exiting.

               iogchar      gets a character.

               iopchar      outputs a character.

               iogquick     gets   a   character  from  the  type  ahead
                            buffer, if one is available.

               iogtimed     reads  a  character  with  timeout.   If   a
                            character  isn't  input,  in  the  number of
                            seconds  specified  .false.   is   returned.
                            Otherwise,  the  character read is placed in
                            "ch" and .true. is returned.

               iopeek       looks to see if a character is in  the  type
                            ahead  buffer.  If a character is available,
                            it  is  placed  in  "ch"   and   .true.   is
                            returned.  If  there  is  not a character in
                            the type ahead buffer, .false. is  returned.
                            Note  that  the  character is not read. This
                            means that the next call to  iogchar()  will
                            return    the    same   character   iopeek()
                            returned.

               iochav       tells if a  character  is  available  to  be
                            read.

               iogstr       attempts  to  get  a line of input. If it is
                            successful, then "str"  contains  the  input
                            characters   and   .true.   is  returned.  A
                            maximum of  "maxlen"  minus  one  characters
                            will  be  put  into "str", although more may
                            have been read. The bell is  rung  when  the
                            user  attempts to enter more characters than
                            fit  in  "str".  The  returned   string   is
                            terminated with an EOS character.

                            Characters  are read up to and including the
                            newline (which is not  returned  in  "str").
                            The  user  can  erase characters with either
                            delete or backspace.  Words  may  be  erased
                            with  ^W.  The  entire  input  line  may  be
                            killed with  ^U  or  ^X.  The  character  ^V
                            escapes   the   special   meaning   of   any
                            character  that   follows.   Other   control

                            characters  that  are  input  are  echoed as
                            visible sequences.

                            If  the  user  attempts   to   delete   more
                            characters  than have been input, .false. is
                            returned.

               iopstr       outputs a string  of  characters  terminated
                            with EOS.

               iopbuf       outputs "n" characters from "buf".

               iopline      writes   out   characters   until  the  EOS;
                            newlines  are   translated   into   carriage
                            return line feed.

               ioflush      flushes  the  output buffer. This routine is
                            automatically called in various places,  but
                            may be used manually too.

               ioeat        flushes the type ahead buffer.

               iocrlf       outputs a carriage return and line feed.

               iospaces     outputs "num" spaces.

               ioerror      terminates  an  iolb  program with a message
                            and status value. The variable  "str"  is  a
                            prilb  format string containing some integer
                            conversion specifier such as "%d", "%x",  or
                            "%o".

               iofmtstr     formats  a  buffer  of characters to contain
                            only    printable    characters.    Carriage
                            returns,   line   feeds,   and   blanks  are
                            compressed into a single blank.

               ioautobroad  changes  iolb's  action  when   a   terminal
                            broadcast    is    received.   By   default,
                            broadcast   messages   are   simply   echoed
                            verbatim.   By  calling  this  routine  with
                            .false., it is possible for  user  to  fetch
                            broadcast  messages using iogbroadcast() and
                            make them synchronous with his program.  The
                            old   setting   of   broadcast  messages  is
                            returned.

               iogbroadcast checks  to  see  if  a  terminal   broadcast
                            message  is  available; if one is available,
                            it  is  stored  in  "buf",  and  .true.   is
                            returned. Otherwise, .false. is returned.

               iovmserror   is   similar   to   ioerror()   except  that
                            "status" is a VMS return  status  and  "str"
                            is  a  prilb format string containing a "%s"
                            that specifies where to put the  error  text
                            for the return status.
