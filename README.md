# RATFOR VAX/VMS Conquest

This is the original RATFOR source code for Conquest for use on
VAX/VMS systems in the 1980's.  Notice the ALL-CAPS naming of the
files.  Good times. :)

When I was in college in the early 1990's, we had this game installed
on the Academic Computing Facility's VAX system.  It was glorious.

This was the inspiration for the "modern day" port of Conquest I
started in the mid-1990's and still maintain today.

The "current" version of Conquest is hosted at
https://github.com/jtrulson/conquest

Needless to say, the current version above does not run on VAXes
anymore, and is way different in many ways than the original was,
though I've tried to keep the general game play as close as possible.

This repository is here for archival/historical purposes only.  It is
not expected that anyone would actually try to use this code, but who
knows.
