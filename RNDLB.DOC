          DESCRIPTION

               All  the  algorithms in this package are from "The Art of
               Computer    Programming",    Vol.    2     (Seminumerical
               Algorithms), sections 3.2.1 and 3.4.1.

               rndini  initialize   the   random  number  package.  This
                       routine must be called before any  of  the  other
                       routines  in  this package can be called. The two
                       seeds are used to initialize the  random  numbers
                       in  a deterministic manner, so that each time you
                       initialize with the same seeds you will  get  the
                       same  sequence.  If  you  want  non-deterministic
                       sequences, use 0 as the seeds,  and  the  current
                       time will be used.

               rnd     random  real  number in the range [0..1). This is
                       the basic  random  number  routine.  All  of  the
                       other   routines  call  this  one.  It  takes  an
                       argument, but it is just a dummy.  It  returns  a
                       random real number between 0 and 1.

               rnduni  random  real  number in the specified range. This
                       routine takes two arguments, a  lower  bound  and
                       an  upper  bound. It returns a random real number
                       between the two bounds.

               rndint  random  integer  in  the  specified  range.  This
                       routine  takes  two  arguments, a lower bound and
                       an upper  bound.  It  returns  a  random  integer
                       between the two bounds, inclusive.

               rndnor  normally  distributed  random  real  number.  The
                       normal  distribution  is  the  well  known  "bell
                       curve",  popular with statisticians. This routine
                       takes  two  arguments,  a  mean  and  a  standard
                       deviation.   It   returns  a  real  number  whose
                       probablilty distribution is the bell  curve  with
                       the specified mean and standard deviation.

               rndexp  exponentially  distributed  random  real  number.
                       This routine  returns  a  real  number  from  the
                       exponential  probability  distribution  with  the
                       specified mean.

               rndchi  random   real   number   with   the    chi-square
                       distribution.  This distribution is also known as
                       the  gamma  distribution  of  order  v/2.  Rndchi
                       could  be  used  to  simulate a situation where a
                       set of observed values are  compared  with  their
                       theoretical    expectations   to   see   if   the
                       differences  are  significant  in  a  statistical
                       sense.   Scintillation   counters   might  be  an
                       example

               rndbta  random real number with  the  beta  distribution.
                       This distribution is less widely used.

               rndF    random  real  number with the F distribtion. This
                       distribution is also known as the  variance-ratio
                       distribution.  The  F  distribution arises in the
                       analysis of variance, where one  wishes  to  test
                       whether    two    populations    have   identical
                       variances.  Consequently,  it  is  important   in
                       regression analysis.

               rndt    random  real  number with the t distribution. You
                       would use the  t  distribution,  instead  of  the
                       normal  distribution,  to  simulate  a case where
                                                   _____                       you are looking at means of small samples,  where
                       the  standard  deviation of the parent population
                       is hard to estimate.

               rndgeo  random integer with  the  geometric  distrbution.
                       If  some  event  occurs with a given probability,
                       then the  number  of  independent  trials  needed
                       until   the   first   event  occurs  (or  between
                       occurrences  of  the  event)  has  the  geometric
                       distribution.

               rndbin  random  integer  with  the binomial distribution.
                       If some event occurs with a given  probability  p
                       and  if  we  carry out t independent trials, then
                       the total number of occurrences N equals  n  with
                       probability:

                                        t    n     t-n
                                       ( )  p  (1-p)
                                        n


               rndpoi  random  integer  with  the  Poisson distribution.
                       The  Poisson  distribution  is  related  to   the
                       exponential    distribution   as   the   binomial
                       distribution is  related  to  the  geometric:  it
                       represents  the  number  of occurrences, per unit
                       time, of an event which can occur at any  instant
                       of   time;  for  example,  the  number  of  alpha
                       particles emitted by a radioactive  substance  in
                       a single  second has a Poisson distribution.  The
                       probability that N = n (u is the mean) is:

                                         -u  n
                                        e   u  /  n !

          BUGS/DEFICIENCIES
               Rndlb  is  almost,  but not quite, portable. As currently
               written, it requires integers at least 28 bits  long.  It
               could  be  re-written  to  use  16-bit  integers, but you
               would have to deal with arithmetic  overflows.  The  only
               parts  affected  would  be rndini, rndseq, and the common
               block.
