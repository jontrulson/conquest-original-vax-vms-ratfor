          DESCRIPTION

               Sclb  is  a  package of routines which lets you do cursor
               addressing, screen clearing, and other  screen  functions
               in   a   terminal-independant   way.   It  is  basicly  a
               convenient interface to the termcap file.

               The user must defined the enviroment variable TERM  to  a
               valid  terminal  type  as  found in the termcap file when
               using a sclb program.

               Descriptions of the routines:

               scinit  initialization  for  the  screen  package.   This
                       routine  must be called before any others in this
                       package.

               sclinit low level initialization for the screen  package.
                       This  routine may be called in place of scinit().
                       If "dodumb" is .false.,  then  sclb  will  behave
                       just  as it does when scinit() is called, i.e. if
                       the termcap file cannot be opened,  if  the  TERM
                       variable  is  not  available,  or if the terminal

                       type cannot be located in the termcap file,  sclb
                       will  abort  by  calling  error(). If "dodumb" is
                       .true., then instead  of  aborting,  a  built  in
                       prototype dumb terminal will be used.

               scend   termination  for  the  screen  package.  You must
                       call this routine before your program exits.

               scclear clear the entire screen.

               schome  move the cursor to the upper left corner  of  the
                       screen.

               scbol   move  the  cursor to the beginning of the current
                       line.

               scleft  move the cursor to the left n columns.

               scright move the cursor to the right n columns.

               scup    move the cursor up n lines.

               scdown  move the cursor down n lines.

               scmove  directly address the cursor.

               scdisp  returns .true. if the  passed  character  can  be
                       displayed, else .false.
